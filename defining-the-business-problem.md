# Defining The Business Problem

## Questions To Ask

1. Why is the problem important?
2. Who does the problem impact?
3. What if we don't have the right data?
4. When is the project over?
5. What if we don't like the results?

## Why is the problem important?

This question sets the expectations for why a project should be undertaken. Identifying the importance of the problem before starting it will help optimize resources such as funding and time. Other ways to ask the question include:

- Why does it matter?
- Has this problem been solved already?
- What is the return on investment?

**Keep the focus on the central business problem** instead of technological trends. Two warning signs to look out for:

- **Methodology focus:**
  - Companies might think that trying new analysis methods or technologies will set them apart. Avoid marketing fluff and trends just for the sake of it.

- **Deliverable focus:**
  - Some projects go off track because companies focus too much on the deliverable. For example, they might insist on an interactive dashboard, but the outcome should be about how the project brings value to the organization, not just adding new deliverables.

Start with the problem to be solved, not the technology to be used. Performing data science for the sake of data science wastes everyone's time. Data science should be used to solve real business problems.

## Who does the problem impact?

Consider how the end users' work will change going forward. Engage all stakeholders in meetings. The answers you get from them should be tied back to the initial question. Two questions to ask the team:

- Can we use the answer?
- Whose work will change?

Explore several scenarios where the problem is solved. This can help strengthen the impact of the project or reveal that it might not benefit the business.

## What if we don't have the right data?

Every set of data has a limited amount of information. At a certain point, there might be no way to go further with it. Not asking this question before starting the project is a mistake. Entering a project knowing that you might not have the right data allows you to create contingency plans. If the data does not exist at all, you can revisit the first question and redefine the scope of the project.

## When is the project over?

Unclear expectations before starting a project can lead to a cascade of issues. Without a clear roadmap, teams may spend excessive time in meetings trying to align their understanding, which can drain productivity and morale. Additionally, poorly defined expectations often lead to excessive reporting, flooding the project with irrelevant information and diluting focus on critical elements. It is essential for project managers and stakeholders to invest time upfront in clarifying expectations to mitigate these challenges and ensure alignment from the outset.

Determine the final deliverable and understand the return on investment. Identify the reasons a project can end. For example, in a data project, the final deliverable might be an insight or an application such as a predictive model.

## What if we don't like the results?

Prepare stakeholders for the possibility that their assumptions might be incorrect. Spending hours on a project only to find out that the result is different from expectations can be challenging. Considering the possibility of unwanted results ensures that a plan is in place for potential bad news. This question can also uncover potential bias before the project starts.

## Understanding Why Data Projects Fail

Projects can fail for various reasons unrelated to data science. However, when data and analysis methods are involved, the list of reasons can grow and become obscured. A project team might use an analysis method they can't explain on data they don't understand to solve a problem that doesn't matter. Yet, they might still feel they succeeded. Hereâ€™s an example:

- **Company X** receives negative media attention over a marketing campaign and assembles a team to monitor customer perception.
- A 'sentiment analysis' project is initiated to interpret customers' emotional reactions on the company's social media accounts. Tweets are labeled as positive or negative, and the results are displayed on a dashboard.
- A month later, the dashboard is completed and updated daily with the latest figures.
- A week later, the dashboard displayed on a TV screen is removed, and no one notices.
- A project postmortem reveals that no one in the company used the analysis, and the marketing team concludes that perception should not be measured solely by social media interaction.

This example highlights the importance of asking "Why is the project important?" The focus was on whether a dashboard could be built rather than understanding its purpose. Additionally, the project team could have asked the following questions before beginning the work:

- Can we use the answer? Consider the relevance of the dashboard.
- Whose work will change? Determine what actions can be taken based on dashboard trends.
